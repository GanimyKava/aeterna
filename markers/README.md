# AR Marker Patterns

This directory should contain AR marker pattern files for the application.

## Required Files

1. `pattern-marker1.patt` - Pattern marker for first set of attractions
2. `pattern-marker2.patt` - Pattern marker for second set of attractions

## How to Generate Markers

1. Open `generate-markers.html` in your browser, or visit:
   https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html

2. Click "Generate" to create a new marker pattern

3. Download the generated `.patt` file

4. Save it in this directory with the names:
   - `pattern-marker1.patt`
   - `pattern-marker2.patt`

## Using the Markers

Once you have the `.patt` files:
- Print them on paper to use physically at attractions
- Display them on a screen/tablet for testing
- The AR camera will detect these markers and display 3D content

## Note

The marker images (usually `.png` or `.jpg`) can be used for:
- Printing physical markers
- Displaying on screens
- Reference when setting up attractions

Make sure to keep both the pattern files (`.patt`) and the marker images for best results.
